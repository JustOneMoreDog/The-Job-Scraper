In business generation and expansion, you\u2019ll be tasked with educating/enabling our partners in qualification of prospect and customer use cases, technical requirements discovery, leading demonstrations, solution identification and design, and collaborative work on proofs-of-concept (PoCs).   The role requires 20-50% travel to attend meetings with partners, attend conferences and other industry events, and to collaborate with your Cloudflare teammates.   Demonstrated experience with a scripting language (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Bash, Lua, Go) and a desire to expand those skills.

You want to be constantly learning new things and teaching what you've learned to the broader team through internal and external blog posts, team demos, and product training sessions.   You have a knack for understanding problems and finding creative ways to solve them.
